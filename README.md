# ArchPath 🏗️

**Learn architectural evolution through the real stories of tech companies**

ArchPath is an interactive educational game where you learn system design by following the architectural evolution of major tech companies from MVP to enterprise scale. Understand not just *what* components to use, but *why* they matter at each stage.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- **Real Architecture Patterns**: Based on actual tech company evolution stories
- **Scaling Decisions**: Why companies choose specific components at different scales  
- **Architectural Reasoning**: Deep explanations of architectural trade-offs
- **Best Practices**: Learn from Netflix, Slack, Uber, Spotify, and Instagram

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Choose a Company**: Select from 5 real tech companies
2. **Build Architecture**: Pick components for each scaling phase
3. **Learn the Why**: Get detailed explanations of architectural decisions
4. **Progress Through Phases**: MVP → First Scale → Growth Scale → Enterprise

## 🏢 Featured Companies

- **Netflix** (Easy): Video streaming platform evolution
- **Slack** (Easy): Real-time workplace communication scaling

## 🎯 Educational Philosophy

ArchPath transforms system design learning from **pattern memorization** to **architectural understanding**:

- **Real Stories**: Based on actual company architecture evolution
- **Contextual Learning**: Understand business drivers behind technical decisions
- **Progressive Complexity**: Start simple, scale appropriately
- **Architectural Reasoning**: Learn the "why" behind every component choice
